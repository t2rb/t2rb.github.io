Simple living

<section class="paragraph">
  <p>
    In the modern consumer society, we no longer take time to enjoy the small
    pleasures of life such as walking barefoot in the grass, admiring the moon,
    listening to the birds sing, or even being bored. Our time is often devoted
    to the relentless pursuit of financial gain to satisfy our material needs,
    which are constantly renewed due to the rapid evolution of technology,
    programmed obsolescence and the omnipresent advertising that surrounds us.
  </p>
  <p>
    People who adopt a frugal lifestyle and consume less are often more
    satisfied with their lives than those who earn less. It seems that
    satisfaction with material consumption is often fleeting, and that we are
    always searching for more, insatiable in our desire to possess. Once a
    purchase decision is made, it is often overshadowed by other concerns, and
    the pleasure of the purchase can be short-lived.
  </p>
  <p>
    The philosopher Schopenhauer developed the thought of satiety, which
    represents the feeling of emptiness and boredom that one may feel after
    having satisfied a desire.
  </p>
  <p>
    Desire is a derivative of need that involves the addition of unnecessary
    elements and pleasure. For example, eating is a basic need, but eating
    caviar is a desire because it involves pleasure and is not necessary for
    survival.
  </p>
  <p>
    By taking a considered approach and asking the right questions, it is
    possible to adopt a minimalist lifestyle by owning only the essential
    material goods. This approach helps to reduce unnecessary consumption,
    appreciate each object for its true purpose, and avoid cluttering up with
    unnecessary possessions.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can also reduce our consumption and carbon footprint by choosing products
    that we really need and that are produced in ethical and sustainable working
    conditions. By taking this approach, not only can we consume less, but we
    can also benefit from more sustainable and economical products in the long
    term.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, we can look at agriculture and our food. It is preferable to
    favour local and seasonal agriculture, as this not only directly supports
    local farmers, but also reduces the greenhouse gas emissions generated by
    the many vehicles involved in the long-distance transport of products, which
    can sometimes travel thousands of kilometres.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a tomato imported out of season can generate up to four times
    more kg of CO2 than a local tomato in season.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is also possible to grow one's own food and move towards food
    self-sufficiency. This approach helps the environment by reducing greenhouse
    gas emissions from transporting goods, as well as ensuring food security in
    the event of a crisis or shortage. In addition, home-grown food can be
    healthier and of better quality, not to mention the benefit of being food
    independent. This can be done on a small scale, even in a small garden or on
    a balcony, by growing herbs, vegetables or fruit.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is possible to live off the grid. This is a radical approach to voluntary
    simplicity which implies a life entirely autonomous and disconnected from
    the electrical network, running water and urban infrastructure. This
    practice may require advanced technical technical skills, as well as
    adjustments in lifestyle and consumption. consumption.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, living off-grid can offer freedom and independence from
    conventional from conventional production and consumption systems and can
    significantly reduce environmental impact. a significant reduction in
    environmental impact. For example, by using renewable energy sources such as
    solar panels or wind turbines, as well as collecting water and by collecting
    water from natural sources.
