    In the modern consumer society, we no longer take time to enjoy the small
    pleasures of life such as walking barefoot in the grass, admiring the moon,
    listening to the birds sing, or even being bored. Our time is often devoted
    to the relentless pursuit of financial gain to satisfy our material needs,
    which are constantly renewed due to the rapid evolution of technology,
    programmed obsolescence and the omnipresent advertising that surrounds us.
  </p>
  <p>
    People who adopt a frugal lifestyle and consume less are often more
    satisfied with their lives than those who earn less. It seems that
    satisfaction with material consumption is often fleeting, and that we are
    always searching for more, insatiable in our desire to possess. Once a
    purchase decision is made, it is often overshadowed by other concerns, and
    the pleasure of the purchase can be short-lived.
