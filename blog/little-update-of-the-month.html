<p>Hello, I am still alive.</p>
<p>I decided to make a small update. It's been three weeks since my last message and I've noticed that people are still visiting my website.</p>
<hr>
<p>This month I finished reading "The Plague" by Albert Camus, a truly great book. I also read and finished "1984" by Orwell, which I enjoyed immensely. Having loved "Kafka on the Shore" by Haruki Murakami, I decided to start reading "The Spring Bird Chronicles". At the beginning, I intended to order it on the Internet, but I realized at the last moment that it was finally available at a stone's throw from my home. So far I've read between one hundred and two hundred pages, but I haven't gone any further. These last days, I spent a lot of time coding intensively.</p>
<p>I learned how to use Node.js and MongoDB to extract data and save it to a database. I also started a Markdown note editor project, a minimalist alternative to Notion. I really like markdown. I have everything well planned out, right down to creating diagrams for possible actions and how the backend works. I am very invested in this project, to the point of working way too much. In the space of a week or so, I must have put in almost 60 hours of work, and my problem is that I always want to get things done, even at the expense of my health. I'm tired of coding, but I love it so much that I've become addicted. In the morning, I used to tend to rush to video games or even Reddit, but now it's just programming. I'm constantly looking for new projects to do. Sometimes I have little burn-outs, like when I was working on my note editor and suddenly lost my patience and deleted everything, only to start from scratch today. The good thing is that with a little hindsight, I understood the mistakes I made and corrected them.</p>
<p>Working at home, I don't really feel the passion anymore. That's why I think that if I persist in working so much, it's to give meaning to my life.</p>
<p>I don't have anything else to add, maybe next time!</p>
